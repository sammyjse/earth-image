Use NASA Open API - Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera

The goal of this project was to brush up my React, HTML, and CSS skills. I wanted to create a small webpage which called NASA's Earth
Polychromatic Imaging Camera API (https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/api). 

The user will have the option to choose a date, and view how the earth looked like during that time. Users will also have the option to choose
another date to compare pictures. 

I have always had a bit of an interest in astronomy and I thought this API was pretty cool. Will use this as practice to work on my 
Python / Django app "form".
