## Project Description 

URL : https://sammyjse.github.io/earth-image/

There were multiple reasons why I wanted to achieve from working on this project. Although there is are more features I would like to add to project, I have been able to complete the core goal that I set out from the start. 

1. One of my goals was to brush up on my React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS skills. So I used this project to not only do that but also learn how to make API calls in React

2. I have always had a bit of an interest in astronomy, and the EPIC API provides daily images of the Earth using DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera instrument. I am available to view the earth at different perspectives, and astronomical events such as the solar eclipse. 

For example on Feb 26th 2017 there was an Annular Solar Eclipse. The images for this through the React app have been added in the repository. 

3. I am also able to view any landscape changes / differences due to climate, however most of these changes are minute as the API only provides images after 2015. 


## Features I would like to add down the line

- Feature to compare images from dates
- Add more data from the EPIC API for each image
- Thermal images
- Solar wind data per image

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
